<p>In order to ensure the freshness and safety of your harvest, please leave a
chilled ice chest near your front door if you cannot be home to receive your
delivery.  If there is no cooler and no answer at your door, we will send you a
notification via email and you may pick up your harvest at no charge from our
distribution site during regular pickup hours.  Thank you for your help and
understanding!</p>

<p>We harvest only what you request.  For this reason, we do not offer
refunds for unclaimed produce.  However, your food will be donated to our
growers or a local food pantry.</p>
