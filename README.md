=================

website for the Austin Yard to Market Co-op (http://www.yardtomarket.coop/)

The site is using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for managing page templates.
Each root HTML file has a YAML header at the top listing the template to use
from the layouts folder and we have common page header and footer HTML in
the _includes folder.

Images should be uploaded to the img folder.  If you have any questions,
just contact unwiredben.

For CSS, we're currently using CDN-hosted generic Bootstrap 3.1.0 from
http://getbootstrap.com.  I'd like to update some styles and do a custom
build once we decide on our brand identify and how our marketing material
will look.
